# Experiment code for a model of aesthetic value
Repository for code and stimulus material for an experiment testing a model of aesthetic value (Brielmann &amp; Dayan, 2021). The experiment mimics the simple concept of a gallery walk. The experiment uses the jsPsych framework (De Leeuw, 2015). 

The code and material can be used to reproduce the conducted experiment or to make modifications for future experiments.


## main code
The folder "js" contains the script "experiment.js" which contains the main code of the experiment apart from the jsPsych functions.


## stimulus material
All images that were used in the experiment are available in the "images" folder. For the experiment trials 55 moprhed dog images were used. The morphs were created by a neural network called Neural Crossbreed (Park et al., 2020).
